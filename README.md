# INTRODUCTION
Are you interested on data analyst? But you are asking to yourself wich skills do I need? Or How much is the salary rate? Let's find out together, that's what I did in this project trying to find wich skills do I need to start and get a job as a data analyst or those diferent fields.
### What do we find?
This project explore the top-paying jobs 💸, in-demand skills 📈 and where those two find together high demands and high salary.

# BACKGROUND
I just recently start in this world about data analitycs because it's a high demand skill, but I wanted to know how to start or what should I learn first? and actually what is the payment. So I ask to my self these questions and actually learned this from a youtube tutorial by Luke Barousse SQL for Data Analytics - Learn SQL in 4 Hours 
### Questions:
- What skills are the most in demand for data analysts?
- What are the most optimal skills to learn?
- What are the top-paying jobs?
- What skills are required for those top-paying jobs?
- Wich skills are associated with higher salaries?
# TOOLS I USED
For this project I used these tools 

- **SQL**: The lenguaje that I used for this proyect allows me to do the querys in the data base to get the results that I was looking for.
- **PostgreSQL**: This data base managment system is one of the most used in the industry so I decided to lear how to used, it was ideal for handling the job posting data
- **Visual Studio Code**: This code editor is not only used for sql querys but also for too many other lenguajes so I decided to use this tool because let me manage the data base and executing the sql querys.
- **Git and Github**: If you want to get a job it is important to show what you know so with the tool you can share your SQL scripts and analysis.
# THE ANALISYS 
We make 5 questions in order to know what do we have to do to work as a data analysis, let´s start with the first one, what skills are the most in demand for data analysis roles.
### What skills are the most in demand for data analysts?
To identify the most demand for data analyst I filtered by skills and count the nomber of job postings by the job id, joining 2 tables using the primary key and afeter that filtered again but just the job title of Data Analyst. This query highlights the most demanded skills.
````sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5


````
Here we can find the most demanded skills for data analys, this five skills are the ones we should learn to find a place in the data analytics wolrd.
- **SQL** with 7291 job postings
- **Excel** with 4611 job postings
- **Python** with 4330 job postings
- **Tableau** with 3745 job postings
- **power bi** with 2609

### What are the most optimal skills to learn?
In order to answer this question we had to make CTE'S to know not only the most demanded jobs but also wich of the job postings are better paied after that we made an inner join to get information of both querys and get the most optimal skills, that is what this query hightlights.
We can see that skills like sql, excel or phyton are not the best payied but highly demanded instead of skills like sas or Go thar are not highly demanded but are well paid, so it means that if you learn highly demanded skills you have more posibilities to get a job easy but if you focus on skills like go, you can get better pay rate but in an specific field.

````sql
WITH skills_demands AS (
    SELECT 
        skills_job_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE 
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_work_from_home = TRUE AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY
        skills_job_dim.skill_id, skills_dim.skills
), average_salary AS (
    SELECT 
        skills_job_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
    WHERE 
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
        job_work_from_home = TRUE
    GROUP BY
        skills_job_dim.skill_id, skills_dim.skills
)

SELECT
    skills_demands.skills,
    skills_demands.skill_id,
    skills_demands.demand_count,
    average_salary.avg_salary
FROM
    skills_demands
INNER JOIN average_salary ON skills_demands.skill_id = average_salary.skill_id
WHERE
    skills_demands.demand_count > 10 
ORDER BY
    skills_demands.demand_count DESC,
    average_salary.avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 30
````
### What are the top-paying jobs?
In this case, we had to make an easy query where we only needed the job title short and filtered by Data Analyst and the by the company name and the salary rate, after that we order the results by salary rate and limited just to get 10 posting jobs. thats what we get.

````sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id    
WHERE 
    job_title = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere'  AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
````
![Top paying jobs](assets/TOP%20PAYING%20JOBS_page-0001.jpg) *Bar graphic visualizing high demanded skills and best paid jobs; Generated by my self on power Bi*


Those are the top 10 job postings for data analyst in any location.

### What skills are required for those top-paying jobs?
Now that we know what are the top paying jobs for data analyst now it´s time to know wich skills do I need for these jobs so we make a CTE and the joining the table of skills to get this result.

````sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id    
    WHERE 
        job_title = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere'  AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
````

### Wich skills are associated with higher salaries?
To answer this question we had to made a query where we had to join 3 tables so we did 2 inner joins to get the information requiered, filtered by data analyst job titles, and this is the result.
````sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    --job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 30
````
As we can see in the graphic those skills are the best paied but are the less demanded so it can be hard to get a job with that skill in my opinion.

# WHAT I LEARNED
While this proyect I know actually how to make sql queries, managing tables and export the information in cvs files to make a visualization on power bi to make the data kinder to the eyes to take better choices
# CONCLUSIONS 
Basically just learned how to use sql, visual studio code and power bi, tools necesaries to data analyst, now it's time to get more proyects and improve my abilities, if you the one who's reading this have any comments just let me know, my intention is to grow and learn.
